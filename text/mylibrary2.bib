               measure is significantly correlated with tail risk measures
               extracted from S\&P 500 index options and negatively predicts
               real economic activity. We show that tail risk has strong
               predictive power for aggregate market returns.
               Cross-sectionally, stocks with high loadings on past tail risk
               earn an annual three-factor alpha 5.4\% higher than stocks with
               low tail risk loadings. We explore potential mechanisms giving

                   vector representations that capture a large number of
                   precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this
                   paper we present several extensions that improve both the
                   quality of the vectors and the training speed. By
                   subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant

                   softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of
                   word representations is their indifference to word order and
                   their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example,
                   the meanings of ``Canada'' and ``Air'' cannot be easily
                   combined to obtain ``Air Canada''. Motivated by this

               remedy the problem that topic models give no guaranty on the

               produced that record human judgements of the interpretability of

              adaptation, as well as the regulatory and fiscal effects of

              further considers the implications of climate change for the

              the transmission of monetary policy, the natural rate of interest

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTClimate change has profound effects not only on
               societies and economies, but also for the ability of central
               banks to deliver price stability in the future. Among others,
               climate change impacts the monetary transmission mechanism, the
               policy space available to central banks, and has implications
               for the design of the monetary policy framework. Thus, taking no
               action is not a viable option, even for central banks without an
               explicit sustainability mandate. This article establishes a
               framework for the integration of climate change objectives into
               monetary policy in the context of the existing central bank
               mandates. Currently, only in a few cases do such mandates refer
               explicitly to sustainable growth and development as a policy
               objective for the central bank. The article discusses several
               possible ways central banks can respond to climate change,
               ranging from protective actions to more proactive measures aimed
               at mitigating climate change by supporting green finance and the
               transition to a low carbon economy. It also focuses on
               understanding the constraints and opportunities for action in
               this arena.Key policy insights Increasingly, central banks are
               being called upon to support an orderly transition to a
               low-carbon economy, not only in their financial stability
               capacity, but also with monetary policy measures.Independently
               of their specific mandate, central banks should consider
               protective and awareness raising actions, to ensure resilience
               vis-{\`a}-vis emerging climate-related risks and to safeguard
               the continued smooth conduct of monetary policy.Subject to their
               mandates, central banks should also consider designing monetary
               operations with green features to proactively support the
               environmental goals of their respective government.While
               proactive measures have the potential to be more impactful, they
               are also more controversial unless the central bank has a clear
               mandate to act on climate.",

               out that monetary policy formulation could also be affected and
               hence the need to deploy monetary policy tools as well. Our
               article seeks to investigate the impacts of climate change,
               particularly extreme weather events, on headline inflation and
               food price inflation and their apparent implications for
               monetary policy in Africa over the period 1990?2017. Using a

               weather-related events may need to be large and consequential to

               consideration for seasonal fluctuations, has yet to be dealt
               with in detail. The aim of this contribution is to present a

               consideration seasonal fluctuations when equalizing time series

               crown/Chinese yuan exchange rate over a period of more than nine
               years. This is the equivalent of 3303 data inputs. Statistica
               software, version 12 by Dell Inc. was used to process the input

              presence of common factors associated with jumps in mean and
              variance, as it performs a decomposition of the conditional
              variance of each asset as the sum of the common factor plus a
              specific transitory factor in a multivariate stochastic
              volatility structure. The estimation is made through Bayesian
              methods using Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The model allows
              recovering the changes in prices and volatility patterns observed
              in this sector, relating the jumps with the events observed in
              the period 2000-2015. We apply the model to estimate risk

              performing a comparison with other multivariate models of

              jumps on intraday correlations, portfolio allocation decisions,

              Co-jumps in the same direction lead to higher correlations and

              the opposite direction reduce correlations and positively affect

  abstract = "This thesis examines three important topics in finance: co-jumps
              among risky assets and portfolios, proposing a new Bayesian
              semiparametric stochastic volatility model with Markovian
              mixtures, and whether better return density forecasts lead to
              economic gains in portfolio allocation practice. First, jump
              models are useful in capturing skewed and/or leptokurtic
              financial returns. So far, research has focused on jumps in a
              single asset, including co-jumps between return and volatility.
              On the other hand, co-jumps among assets are also important
              especially in practices such as beta dynamics and portfolio
              allocation. I propose a parsimonious yet flexible multivariate
              GARCH-jump mixture model (MGARCH-jump model) with multivariate
              jumps that allows both jump sizes and jump arrivals to be
              correlated. The model identities co-jumps well and shows that
              both jump arrivals and jump sizes are highly correlated. The
              model also provides better prediction and better investment
              outcomes as opposed to the benchmark multivariate GARCH model
              with normal innovations (MGARCH-N model). Second, I extend the
              Bayesian semiparametric stochastic volatility (SV-DPM) model of
              Jensen and Maheu (2010). Instead of using a Dirichlet process
              mixture (DPM) to capture return innovations, we use an infinite
              hidden Markov model (IHMM). This allows for time variation in the
              return density beyond that attributed to latent volatility
              dynamics. The new model (SV-IHMM) also nests the SV-DPM as a
              special case and improves the density forecast from the SV model
              with Student-t innovations, SV-DPM and other benchmark models.
              Our model is applied to equity stock returns, foreign exchange
              rates, commodity prices and industrial growth rates. The model
              demonstrates robust and consistent gains in out-of-sample
              performance against other benchmarks. Furthermore, predictive
              densities from the SV-IHMM exhibit clear distributional change
              over time. Third, I investigate the relationship between
              statistical improvements in density forecasts of returns and
              actual economic gains in portfolio allocation for a risk-averse
              investor. To aid this investigation, this chapter proposes a new
              multivariate Bayesian semiparametric model that has better
              out-of-sample density forecasts than benchmark models. Results
              show that this more sophisticated econometric model does provide
              positive economic gains whether the investor's utility is CRRA,
              CARA or quadratic. The economic gain diminishes when the investor
              is more risk-averse because she is moving away from risky
              investment positions.",

               in the oil market stimulated by extreme events such as oil
               platform explosions, geopolitical events, and financial crises
               and to understand the reaction and the persistence of these
               effects on the commodity's price. Originality/value: The
               prominent position of oil raises the concerns of investors,
               producers, and policymakers because of the unstable behaviour of
               its price level and pattern of volatility. This justifies the
               need to investigate the dynamics of this behaviour for the
               purposes of economic policy formation, strategies around trade
               and costs, and revenue calculations for companies of this
               sector, as well as investment decisions for other sources of
               energy. Design/methodology/approach: In order to model the
               occurrence of volatility jumps caused by extreme events, four
               specifications were used for the ARJI-GARCH conditional jumping
               methodology developed by Chan and Maheu (2002). The data consist
               of 2008 daily records of the closing price of light oil (WTI)
               from January 2010 to December 2017 obtained from NYMEX.
               Findings: Among several results it was verified that the
               occurrence of extreme events causes significant changes in the
               oil price, which goes against the efficient market hypothesis,
               and that a time-varying conditional jump process can be
               specified, but it has little sensibility to past shocks and very
               short-term persistence.",

              explicitly model cross-sectional dependence in the variance

                  and the decline has been particularly pronounced in the
                  high-tech sector post-2000. Do labor market frictions play a
                  role in declining young firm activities and the associated
                  slower productivity growth? Using a longitudinal worker-firm
                  matched dataset from the U.S. Census Bureau, I document that
                  declining young firm activities are accompanied by: 1) a
                  decline in the growth rate of the demand for skills in the
                  high-tech sector, and 2) a flattening of the life cycle of
                  skilled labor accumulation of high-tech firms. By developing
                  an endogenous growth firm dynamics model that is consistent
                  with the micro-level skilled labor accumulation over the firm
                  life cycle, I show that rising frictions in skilled labor
                  adjustment can explain the joint evolution of young firm
                  employment shares and demand for skills. These frictions
                  influence productivity growth through affecting the stock of
                  human capital firms possess. A calibrated model shows that a
                  rise in skilled labor adjustment costs lowers productivity
                  growth by 75 basis points in the high-tech sector. A rise in
                  entry costs, on the other hand, is not likely the main driver

                  increase in demand for skills. Finally, productivity gain
                  (loss) from reallocation can be offset by the general

                 1950-2008. We exploit random within-country year-to-year
                 variation in cyclone strikes to identify the causal effect of
                 environmental disasters on long-run growth. We compare each
                 country's growth rate to itself in the years immediately
                 before and after exposure, accounting for the distribution of
                 cyclones in preceding years. The data reject hypotheses that
                 disasters stimulate growth or that short-run losses disappear
                 following migrations or transfers of wealth. Instead, we find
                 robust evidence that national incomes decline, relative to
                 their pre-disaster trend, and do not recover within twenty
                 years. Both rich and poor countries exhibit this response,
                 with losses magnified in countries with less historical
                 cyclone experience. Income losses arise from a small but
                 persistent suppression of annual growth rates spread across
                 the fifteen years following disaster, generating large and
                 significant cumulative effects: a 90th percentile event
                 reduces per capita incomes by 7.4\% two decades later,
                 effectively undoing 3.7 years of average development. The
                 gradual nature of these losses render them inconspicuous to a
                 casual observer, however simulations indicate that they have
                 dramatic influence over the long-run development of countries
                 that are endowed with regular or continuous exposure to
                 disaster. Linking these results to projections of future
                 cyclone activity, we estimate that under conservative
                 discounting assumptions the present discounted cost of
                 ``business as usual'' climate change is roughly \$9.7 trillion

  abstract = "Growth theory predicts that natural disasters should, on impact,
              lower GDP per capita. However, the empirical literature does not
              offer conclusive evidence. Most existing studies use disaster
              data drawn from damage records of insurance companies. We argue
              that this may lead to estimation bias as damage data and the
              selection into the database may correlate with GDP. We build a
              comprehensive database of disaster events and their intensities
              from primary geophysical and meteorological information. In
              contrast to insurance data, our GeoMet data reveal a substantial
              negative and robust average impact effect of disasters on growth.
              The worst 5\% disaster years come with a growth damage of at
              least 0.46 percentage points. That average effect is driven
              mainly by very large earthquakes and some meteorological
              disasters. Poor countries are more strongly affected by
              geophysical disasters; rich more by meteorological events.

              from the recommendation of a single carbon price for all uses at
              all places and times. This paper provides some of the analytics
              behind these recommendations. First, I analyze the circumstances
              in which distributional concerns make desirable a tax or
              regulation inducing significant reductions in carbon usage in a
              carbon-intensive sector for which consumers are

              the resulting production inefficiency may, under the identified
              circumstances, be less than the distributional benefits. The
              paper considers the circumstances in which such differential

              differential pricing, as well as differential effects on

              general conditions under which the optimal carbon path should, at
              least eventually, be falling over time. Finally, I revisit the

               build a model where heterogeneous firms invest in physical and
               intangible capital, and can default on their debt. In case of
               default, intangible assets are harder to seize by creditors.
               Hence, intangible capital faces higher financing costs. This
               differential is exacerbated in a financial crisis, when default
               is more likely and aggregate risk bears a higher premium. The
               resulting fall in intangible investment amplifies the crisis,
               and gradual intangible spillovers to other firms contribute to
               its persistence. Using panel data on Spanish manufacturing
               firms, I estimate the model matching firm-level moments
               regarding intangibles and financing. The model captures the
               extent and components of the Great Recession in Spanish
               manufacturing, whereas a standard model without endogenous
               intangible investment would miss more than half of the GDP fall.
               A policy of transfers conditional on firm age could speed up the
               recovery, as young firms tend to be more financially
               constrained, particularly regarding intangible investment.
               Conditioning transfers on firm size or subsidizing credit (as in

               meanings reported in Section 1A of SEC form 10-K. The idea of
               ML-CKNN is to compute a categorical similarity score for each
               label by the K-nearest neighbors in that category. ML-CKNN is
               tailored to achieve the goal of extracting risk factors from
               10Ks. The proposed algorithm can perfectly classify 74.94\% of
               risk factors and 98.75\% of labels. Moreover, ML-CKNN is
               empirically shown to outperform ML-KNN and other multilabel
               algorithms. The extracted risk factors could be valuable to
               empirical studies in accounting or finance.",

              consumption to monetary policy shocks by varying labor income for
              hand-to-mouth agents. We document three secular changes that
              weaken this channel: (i) labor's share of value added in
              investment goods production has declined, (ii) the import share
              of investment goods has risen, and (iii) the composition of
              investment has shifted towards components that are less

               investment and borrowing become endogenous: pledgeable assets
               support more borrowings that in turn allow for further
               investment in pledgeable assets. We show that this credit
               multiplier has an important impact on investment when firms face
               credit constraints: investment-cash flow sensitivities are
               increasing in the degree of tangibility of constrained firms'
               assets. If firms are unconstrained, however, investment-cash
               flow sensitivities are unaffected by asset tangibility.
               Crucially, asset tangibility itself may determine whether a firm
               faces credit constraints - firms with more tangible assets may
               have greater access to external funds. This implies that the
               relationship between capital spending and cash flows is
               non-monotonic in the firm's asset tangibility. Our theory allows
               us to use a differences-in-differences approach to identify the
               effect of financing frictions on corporate investment: we
               compare the differential effect of asset tangibility on the
               sensitivity of investment to cash flow across different regimes
               of financial constraints. We implement this testing strategy on
               a large sample of manufacturing firms drawn from COMPUSTAT
               between 1985 and 2000. Our tests allow for the endogeneity of
               the firm's credit status, with asset tangibility influencing
               whether a firm is classified as credit constrained or
               unconstrained in a switching regression framework. The data
               strongly support our hypothesis about the role of asset
               tangibility on corporate investment under financial constraints.",

              to the US economy from the financial crisis, NBER Macroeconomics
              Annual, Bureau of Economic Research, 2014). We explore firm-level
              data on investment and document that investment fell relative to
              fundamentals at the turn of the millennium---well before the
              Great Recession. This downturn in investment coincides with a
              shift in employment toward services and cognitive skills---the
              ``polarization'' described by Autor et al. (Am Econ Rev
              96(2):189--194, 2006), as a possible consequence of off-shoring
              and automation. An analogous sorting of firms into industries
              shows a shift of investment toward spatially ``grounded''
              industries, such as energy and telecommunications, from which
              capital cannot be relocated. Investment shifts away from
              production sectors, such as manufacturing, which can be
              relocated. While high-tech firms grow in number and value, this
              growth is associated with a flat share of capital investment. For
              these sectors, we document a shift toward intangible, rather than
              physical, capital. The ``hollowing out'' of investment, like
              labor, carves out manufacturing and production sectors, leaving
              grounded industries that are less susceptible to off-shoring and

               substitution/complementary relationship and the workers' skill

               cross-country, cross-industry data set, considering different

               intangible assets and high-technology investments are taking
               larger roles. These developments have raised a number of
               concerns, such as: how do we measure intangible assets? Are we
               accurately appraising newer, high-technology capital? The
               answers to these questions have broad implications for the
               assessment of the economy's growth over the long term, for the
               pace of technological advancement in the economy, and for
               estimates of the nation's wealth. In Measuring Capital in the
               New Economy, Carol Corrado, John Haltiwanger, Daniel Sichel, and
               a host of distinguished collaborators offer new approaches for

               business model. P2P lending is the most popular type of

               collectively a larger loan to individuals or businesses. Unlike

               own contractual positions. Whereas banks accumulate risks by
               taking positions on their balance sheet, platforms decentralise

               platforms requires a different regulatory approach than banking.

               in the UK and other countries, and assesses the business and
               economic policy issues surrounding this new form of
               intermediation. P2P platform technology allows direct matching
               of borrowers' and lenders' diversification over a large number
               of borrowers without the loans having to be held on an
               intermediary balance sheet. P2P lending has developed rapidly in
               both the US and the UK, but it still represents a small
               fraction, less than 1\%, of the stock of bank lending. In the UK
               -- but not elsewhere -- it is an important source of loans for
               smaller companies. We argue that P2P lending is fundamentally
               complementary to, and not competitive with, conventional
               banking. We therefore expect banks to adapt to the emergence of
               P2P lending, either by cooperating closely with third-party P2P
               lending platforms or offering their own proprietary platforms.
               We also argue that the full development of the sector requires
               much further work addressing the risks and business and
               regulatory issues in P2P lending, including risk communication,
               orderly resolution of platform failure, control of liquidity
               risks and minimisation of fraud, security and operational risks.

              Regulatory responses have varied greatly between countries, and
              the characteristics of the markets that have emerged vary as a
              result. We describe and evaluate the range of P2P lending systems
              on offer to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in several
              countries, considering different regulatory regimes. In some
              countries, there are problematic incentives for platforms that
              rate credit and originate loans without holding the risk of these
              loans. In addition, when investor returns are guaranteed by
              platforms, investors have no incentive to distinguish among risk
              categories. In several countries, notably the People's Republic
              of China, P2P platforms have engaged in fraudulent behavior and
              Ponzi-like schemes. On the other hand, stringent regulation in
              the United States has excessively impeded new entrants from
              providing competition to established platforms. Regulators should
              be mindful of these risks and others, while also seeking to
              capitalize on the benefits that the sector offers for providing
              new funding opportunities to SMEs. In our view, the United

               opportunities, among which improved speed, better customer
               experience, and reduced costs. However, peer-to-peer lending

              trade loan contracts before maturity and some P2P lending

               interpreting advertising expenditures as an investment in brand
               capital, the approach in this paper provides a novel way to
               measure brand equity grounded in economic theory. Using the
               Euler equations from the firm's maximization problem, I derive
               closed-form expressions for the firm's equilibrium stock returns

                 economic growth. Few academic studies, however, examine the
                 direct link between immigration and growth. And the evidence
                 on the outcomes that the literature does examine (such as the
                 impact on wages or government receipts and expenditures) is
                 far too mixed to allow unequivocal inferences. This paper
                 surveys what we know about the relationship between
                 immigration and growth. The canonical Solow model implies that
                 a one-time supply shock will not have any impact on
                 steady-state per-capita income, while a continuous supply
                 shock will permanently reduce per-capita income. The observed
                 relationship between immigration and growth obviously depends
                 on many variables, including the skill composition of
                 immigrants, the rate of assimilation, the distributional labor
                 market consequences, the size of the immigration surplus, the
                 potential human capital externalities, and the long-term
                 fiscal impact. Despite the methodological disagreements about
                 how to measure all of these effects, there is a consensus on
                 one important point: Immigration has a more beneficial impact
                 on growth when the immigrant flow is composed of high-skill

               responsible for the recent behavior of the U.S. skill premium,

               This paper develops a framework for understanding this notion in
               terms of observable variables and uses the framework to evaluate
               the fraction of the skill premium's variation that is caused by
               changes in observables. A version of the neoclassical growth
               model is used in which the key feature of aggregate technology
               is capital-skill complementarity: the elasticity of substitution
               is higher between capital equipment and unskilled labor than
               between capital equipment and skilled labor. With this feature,
               changes in observables can account for nearly all the variation
               in the skill premium over the last 30 years. This finding
               suggests that increased wage inequality results from economic

              slow pace began prior to the Great Recession. The timing thus
              suggests that it is important to consider factors other than just
              the deep crisis itself or policy changes since the crisis. For
              the United States, at the frontier of knowledge, there was a
              burst of innovation and reallocation related to the production
              and use of information technology in the second half of the 1990s

               developments in credit markets work to amplify and propagate

               stochastic volatility using four different approaches: second-
               and third-order perturbation, Chebyshev polynomials, and value

               supported by the trade-off, pecking order and market timing
               capital structure theories (Korajczyk and Levy in J Financ Econ

               persistence, previous literature dictates that the trade-off and

               cycles. Since financial cycles last longer than business cycles,
               financial cycles should have a long term effect on leverage. Our

  author    = "Barclay, Michael J and Smith, Clifford",
  abstract  = "Since the formulation of the Miller and Modigliani propositions
               over 60 years ago, financial economists have been debating
               whether there is such a thing as an optimal capital structure?a
               proportion of debt to equity that can be expected to maximize
               long-run shareholder value. Some finance scholars have followed
               M\&M in arguing that both capital structure and dividend policy
               are irrelevant in the sense of having no significant,
               predictable effects on corporate market values. Another school
               of thought holds that corporate financing choices reflect an
               attempt by corporate managers to balance the tax shields and
               disciplinary benefits of more debt against the costs of
               financial distress. Still another theory says that companies do
               not have capital structure targets, but instead follow a
               financial pecking order in which retained earnings are generally
               preferred to outside financing, and debt is preferred to equity
               when outside funding is required. In reviewing the evidence that
               has accumulated since M\&M, the authors argue that taxes,
               bankruptcy and other contracting costs, and information costs
               all appear to play important roles in corporate financing
               decisions. While much, if not most, of the evidence is
               consistent with the idea that companies set target leverage
               ratios, there is also considerable support for the pecking order
               theory's contention that managements are willing to deviate
               widely from their targets for long periods of time. According to
               the authors, the key to reconciling the different theories?and
               thus to solving the capital structure puzzle?lies in achieving a
               better understanding of the relation between corporate financing
               stocks (that is, total amounts of debt and equity) and flows
               (which security to issue at a particular time). Even when
               companies have leverage targets, it can make sense to deviate
               from those targets depending on the costs associated with moving
               back toward the target. And as the authors argue in closing, a
               complete theory of capital structure must take account of these
               adjustment costs and how they affect expected deviations from
               the targets.",

  abstract  = "There are several different economic barriers such as high
               up-front capital costs, high transaction costs and diverse risks
               (e.g. performance and technical, contract risks, market risks)
               that keep potential investors or institutional lenders from
               investing in decentralized renewable energy technologies (RETs).
               Therefore, suitable business models, specific financing concepts
               and advanced risk management tools to deal with issues
               concerning transaction costs and financial risks are required to
               support RET investments.This article deals with this issue by
               introducing a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) approach to risk
               analysis based on an entire life-cycle representation of
               RET-investment projects. By doing this, the authors uncover
               considerable advantages regarding content and methodology
               compared to ordinary NPV-estimation or sensitivity analysis. It
               could be shown that the presented financial analysis combined
               with MCS aids in optimizing the conceptual design of an
               investment project with respect to capital returns and risk.
               Since both issues are decisive for lenders and investors, the
               double-criteria analysis method presented in this paper
               facilitates the raising of capital for project investments in
               decentralized RETs.",

               mechanisms to equilibrate the loan market. This complexity makes
               the behaviour of lending pools difficult to understand and to
               predict: indeed, ineffective incentives and attacks could
               potentially lead to emergent unwanted behaviours. Reasoning
               about lending pools is made even harder by the lack of
               executable models of their behaviour: to precisely understand
               how users interact with lending pools, eventually one has to
               inspect their implementations, where the incentive mechanisms
               are intertwined with low-level implementation details. Further,
               the variety of existing implementations makes it difficult to

                 during this period, the impact on external balance sheet
                 positions was mitigated by valuation gains. This is because,

                 currency-induced valuation gains on equity positions
                 offsetting losses on debt positions, partly due to reduced
                 currency mismatch on their external debt positions.",

              central bank using unconventional monetary policy to combat a

              policy as expanding central bank credit intermediation to offset
              a disruption of private financial intermediation. Within our
              framework the central bank is less efficient than private
              intermediaries at making loans but it has the advantage of being
              able to elastically obtain funds by issuing riskless government
              debt. Unlike private intermediaries, it is not balance sheet
              constrained. During a crisis, the balance sheet constraints on
              private intermediaries tighten, raising the net benefits from
              central bank intermediation. These benefits may be substantial

  abstract    = "We build on the Maddison GDP data to assemble international
                 time series from before 1914 on real per capita personal
                 consumer expenditure, C. We also improve the GDP data in many
                 cases. The C variable comes closer than GDP to the consumption
                 concept that enters into usual asset-pricing equations. (A
                 separation of consumer expenditure into durables and
                 non-durables is feasible for only a minority of cases.) We
                 have essentially full annual data on C for 22 countries and
                 GDP for 35 countries, and we plan to complete the long-term
                 time series for a few more countries. For samples that start
                 as early as 1870, we apply a peak-to-trough method for each
                 country to isolate economic crises, defined as cumulative
                 declines in C or GDP by at least 10\%. The principal world
                 economic crises ranked by importance are World War II, World
                 War I and the Great Depression, the early 1920s (possibly
                 reflecting the influenza epidemic of 1918-20), and post-World
                 War II events such as the Latin American debt crisis and the
                 Asian financial crisis. We find 87 crises for C and 148 for
                 GDP, implying disaster probabilities around 3.6\% per year.
                 The disaster size has a mean of 21-22\% and an average
                 duration of 3.5 years. A comparison of C and GDP declines
                 shows roughly coincident timing. The average fractional
                 decline in C exceeds that in GDP during wartime crises but is
                 similar for non-war crises. We simulate a Lucas-tree model
                 with i.i.d. growth shocks and Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences.
                 This simulation accords with the observed average equity
                 premium of around 7\% on levered equity, using a
                 ``reasonable'' coefficient of relative risk aversion of 3.5.
                 This result is robust to a number of perturbations, except for
                 limiting the sample to non-war crises, a selection that
                 eliminates most of the largest declines in C and GDP. We plan
                 a statistical analysis that uses all the time-series data and
                 includes estimation of long-run effects of crises on levels
                 and growth rates of C and GDP. We will also study the
                 bond-bill premium (empirically around 1\%) and allow for

               2, Fall 1997, pages 3-10. Hal Varian (born 1947) is widely known
               by professional economists for his pathbreaking work in the
               economics of information and networks. Many more know him as the
               author of two bestselling microeconomics textbooks, one written
               for undergraduate college students and one designed for advanced
               graduate students. Through his research and his books, Professor
               Varian?s ideas have influenced a generation of economists. In
               this paper, Professor Varian outlines how he approaches the task
               of building an economic model to explain an observed phenomena
               or solve a problem. His words are encouraging advice for
               graduate students and young economists learning how to ?practice
               the art? of economics. Professor Varian offers a number of tips
               ranging from how to choose a topic, when to read the literature,
               and even to how to effectively manage your bibliographic
               citations. Professor Varian?s advice has passed the market test
               as this paper remains one of the most referenced and downloaded
               papers in The American Economist?s backfile. However, after

               equation technique of dynamic programming [1].In this paper, it
               will be shown that the functional equation approach yields, in
               simple and intuitive fashion, formal derivations of such
               classical necessary conditions of the Calculus of Variations as
               the Euler-Lagrange equations, the Weierstrass and Legendre

               necessary conditions for the case where the decision variables

              capture surprise effects, and show that these models offer a good

              understanding many empirical phenomena. Jump (Poisson) processes
              capture empirical features of the data which would not be

               yields has produced an enormous literature with its own journals
               and graduate courses. Those who want to join the quest are faced
               with considerable obstacles. The literature has evolved mostly
               in continuous time, where stochastic calculus reigns and partial
               differential equations spit fire. The knights in this literature
               are fighting for different goals, which makes it often difficult
               to comprehend why the quest is moving in certain directions.
               Bond yield movements over time can be captured by simple vector
               auto regressions in yields and maybe other macroeconomic
               variables. Several aspects of bond yields, however, set them
               apart from other variables typically used in vector auto
               regression studies. One aspect is that bonds are assets and that
               bonds with many different maturities are traded at the same
               time. Bonds with long maturities are risky when held over short
               horizons, and risk-averse investors demand compensation for
               bearing such risk. Arbitrage opportunities in these markets
               exist unless long yields are risk-adjusted expectations of
               average future short rates. Movements in the cross section of
               yields are, therefore, closely tied together.",

               theory using data from U.S. national accounts, business
               censuses, and brokered sales to estimate a value for sweat
               equity in the private business sector equal to 1.2 times U.S.
               GDP, which is about the same magnitude as the value of fixed
               assets in use in these businesses. For a typical owner, 26\% of
               the sweat equity is transferable through inheritance or sale.
               The equity values are positively correlated with business
               incomes and standard measures of markups based on accounting
               data, but not with owners' financial assets or standard measures

               foundation in macroeconomic models. We document, however, that
               the global labor share has significantly declined since the
               early 1980s, with the decline occurring within the large
               majority of countries and industries. We show that the decrease
               in the relative price of investment goods, often attributed to
               advances in information technology and the computer age, induced
               firms to shift away from labor and toward capital. The lower
               price of investment goods explains roughly half of the observed

              transformed high-skilled labor from a pure labor input to a class
              of ``human capitalists.'' We show that high-skilled labor earns
              substantial income in the form of equity claims to firms' future
              dividends and capital gains. Equity-based compensation has
              dramatically increased since the 1980s, representing forty
              percent of total compensation to high-skilled labor in recent
              years. Ignoring equity income causes incorrect measurement of the
              returns to high-skilled labor, with substantial effects on
              macroeconomic trends. In our sample, including equity-based
              compensation in high-skilled labor income reduces the total
              decline in labor's wage-only income share relative to total
              value-added since the 1980s by over 30\%. The inclusion of

              during the last three decades. Whereas in the early 1980s most of
              global investment was funded by household saving, nowadays nearly
              two-thirds of global investment is funded by corporate saving.
              This shift in the sectoral composition of saving was not
              accompanied by changes in the sectoral composition of investment,
              implying an improvement in the corporate net lending position. We
              characterize the behavior of corporate saving using both national
              income accounts and firm-level data and clarify its relationship
              with the global decline in labor share, the accumulation of
              corporate cash stocks, and the greater propensity for equity
              buybacks. We develop a general equilibrium model with product and
              capital market imperfections to explore quantitatively the

              intangible assets---at a rate close to that of tangible
              assets---changes in GDP, which does not include all intangible
              investments, understate the actual changes in total output. If
              labor inputs are more precisely measured, then it is possible to
              observe little change in measured total factor productivity (TFP)
              coincidentally with large changes in hours and investment. The
              output mismeasurement leaves business cycle modelers with large
              and unexplained labor wedges accounting for most of the
              fluctuations in aggregate data. To address this issue, I
              incorporate intangible investments into a multi-sector general
              equilibrium model and use data from an updated U.S. input and
              output table to parameterize income and cost shares, with
              intangible investments reassigned from intermediate to final
              uses. I employ maximum-likelihood methods and quarterly
              observations on sectoral gross outputs for the United States to
              estimate processes for latent sectoral TFPs that have common and
              sector-specific components. I do not use aggregate hours to
              estimate TFPs but find that the predicted hours series compares
              closely with the actual series and accounts for roughly
              two-thirds of its standard deviation. I find that sector-specific
              shocks and industry linkages play an important role in accounting
              for fluctuations and comovements in aggregate and industry-level
              U.S. data, and I find that at business-cycle frequencies, the
              model's common component of TFP is not correlated with the
              standard measures of aggregate TFP used in the macroeconomic
              literature. Adding financial frictions and stochastic shocks to
              financing constraints has a negligible impact on the results.",

              In an optimal contract, a successful entrepreneur repays yet an
              unsuccessful one defaults and liquidates his assets. The bounds
              on liquidation generate, however, a second equilibrium where
              domestic borrowers default because others are also defaulting.
              During these coordinated defaults tax collections fall which
              increases sovereign default risk. In the model joint debt crises

              accumulation within a standard model of exchange rate
              determination with nontraded goods. The model predicts that
              currencies of countries that are more ``systemic'' for the world
              economy (countries that face particularly volatile shocks or
              account for a large share of world GDP) appreciate when the price

              investors because they appreciate in ``bad'' states of the world.
              As a consequence, more systemic countries face a lower cost of
              capital and accumulate more capital per worker. We estimate our

               asymmetry? We model investors, endowed with a small home
               information advantage, who choose what information to learn
               before they invest. Surprisingly, even when home investors can
               learn what foreigners know, they choose not to: Investors profit
               more from knowing information others do not know. Learning
               amplifies information asymmetry. The model matches patterns of
               local and industry bias, foreign investments, portfolio
               outperformance, and asset prices. Finally, we propose new
               avenues for empirical research.",

               between US monetary policy, real activity and global financial

  abstract = "Why do investors trade a lot in foreign assets and hold so little
              of them in their portfolios? This paper shows that both
              observations can arise naturally in the presence of
              nondiversifiable nontraded consumption risk when each country
              specializes in production, preferences exhibit consumption home
              bias, and asset markets are incomplete. Using a general
              equilibrium two-country, two-sector (tradable and nontradable)
              model of the world economy with production I show that low
              diversification occurs because variations in relative prices (i)
              increase the riskiness of foreign assets and (ii) facilitate
              risk-sharing across countries. Large and volatile capital flows
              are necessary to take advantage of international risk premia
              differentials that occur in response to productivity changes in
              the nontradable sector. I characterize the optimal portfolio
              holdings, the evolution of the investment opportunity set, the
              risk premium, and the dynamics of capital flows using a new
              methodology for solving dynamic general equilibrium models with

              capital flow movements using data that differentiates activity by
              foreigners and domestics. We identify episodes of ``surges'' and
              ``stops'' (sharp increases and decreases, respectively, of gross
              inflows) and ``flight'' and ``retrenchment'' (sharp increases and
              decreases, respectively, of gross outflows). Our approach yields
              fundamentally different results than the previous literature that
              used measures of net flows. Global factors, especially global
              risk, are significantly associated with extreme capital flow
              episodes. Contagion, whether through trade, banking, or

               quantitative models of economic fluctuations. The method rests
               on the insight that many models are equivalent to a prototype
               growth model with time-varying wedges that resemble
               productivity, labor and investment taxes, and government
               consumption. Wedges that correspond to these
               variables-efficiency, labor, investment, and government
               consumption wedges-are measured and then fed back into the model
               so as to assess the fraction of various fluctuations they
               account for. Applying this method to U.S. data for the Great
               Depression and the 1982 recession reveals that the efficiency
               and labor wedges together account for essentially all of the
               fluctuations; the investment wedge plays a decidedly tertiary
               role, and the government consumption wedge plays none. Analyses
               of the entire postwar period and alternative model
               specifications support these results. Models with frictions

               firm-level data for the U.S. economy since 1955. We measure both
               markups and profitability. In 1980, aggregate markups start to
               rise from 21\% above marginal cost to 61\% now. The increase is
               driven mainly by the upper tail of the markup distribution: the
               upper percentiles have increased sharply. Quite strikingly, the
               median is unchanged. In addition to the fattening upper tail of
               the markup distribution, there is reallocation of market share
               from low- to high-markup firms. This rise occurs mostly within
               industry. We also find an increase in the average profit rate
               from 1\% to 8\%. Although there is also an increase in overhead
               costs, the markup increase is in excess of overhead. We discuss
               the macroeconomic implications of an increase in average market
               power, which can account for a number of secular trends in the
               past four decades, most notably the declining labor and capital

  abstract  = "[In the postwar era, developed economies have experienced two
               substantial trends in the net capital share of aggregate income:
               a rise during the last several decades, which is well known, and
               a fall of comparable magnitude that continued until the 1970s,
               which is less well known. Overall, the net capital share has
               increased since 1948, but once disaggregated this increase turns
               out to come entirely from the housing sector: the contribution
               to net capital income from all other sectors has been zero or
               slightly negative, as the fall and rise have offset each other.
               Several influential accounts of the recent rise emphasize the
               role of increased capital accumulation, but this view is at odds
               with theory and evidence: it requires empirically improbable
               elasticities of substitution, and it presumes a correlation
               between the capital-income ratio and capital share that is not
               visible in the data. A more limited narrative that stresses

               switches observed in emerging markets, our premise is that these
               economies are subject to substantial volatility in trend growth.
               Our methodology exploits the information in consumption and net

              intermediation to study the different roles of the condition of
              banks' and firms' balance sheets in real activity. The net worth
              of firms determines their borrowing capacity both from households
              and banks. Banks provide risky loans to multiple firms and use
              their diversified portfolio as collateral to borrow from
              households. This intermediation process allows additional funds
              to flow from households to firms. Banks require net worth for
              intermediation as they are exposed to aggregate risk. The net
              worth of banks and firms are both state variables. In normal
              recessions, firm and bank net worth play the same role and their
              sum determines the allocation of capital. During financial
              crises, shocks to bank net worth have an additional effect beyond
              that in standard financial frictions' models. This mechanism

               heterogeneity in the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in
               consumption (EIS). The model is consistent with some prominent
               features of asset prices, such as a high equity premium,
               relatively smooth interest rates, procyclical stock prices, and
               countercyclical variation in the equity premium, its volatility,
               and in the Sharpe ratio. In this model, the risk-free asset
               market plays a central role by allowing non-stockholders (with
               low EIS) to smooth the fluctuations in their labor income. This
               process concentrates non-stockholders' labor income risk among a
               small group of stockholders, who then demand a high premium for
               bearing the aggregate equity risk. Furthermore, this mechanism

               problematic for previous models with limited participation. I
               show that this large wealth inequality is also important for the
               model's ability to generate a countercyclical equity premium.
               When it comes to business cycle performance, the model's
               progress has been more limited: consumption is still too
               volatile compared to the data, whereas investment is still too

              commonly used in the macro-finance literature and can be seen as
              a first-order perturbation around the risky steady state.
              Therefore, we unify coexisting theories of risk-adjusted
              linearizations. We provide a formal foundation for approximation
              methods that remained so far heuristic, and offer explicit
              formulas for approximate equilibrium objects and conditions for
              their local existence and uniqueness. Affine approximations are
              not nested in conventional perturbations of arbitrary order. We
              apply this technique to models featuring Campbell-Cochrane
              habits, recursive preferences, and time-varying disaster risk.
              The proposed affine approximation performs similarly to global

              the volatility of both nominal and real exchange rates after the
              end of the Bretton Woods System of pegged exchange rates in early
              1970s - is commonly viewed as a central piece of evidence in
              favor of monetary non-neutrality. Indeed, a change in the em
              monetary regime has caused a dramatic change in the equilibrium
              behavior of a real variable - the real exchange rate. The Mussa
              fact is further interpreted as direct evidence in favor of models
              with nominal rigidities in price setting (sticky prices). We show
              that this last conclusion is not supported by the data, as there
              was no simultaneous change in the properties of the other macro
              variables - neither nominal like inflation, nor real like
              consumption, output or net exports. We show that the extended set
              of Mussa facts equally falsifies both conventional flexible-price
              RBC models and sticky-price New Keynesian models. We present a
              resolution to this broader puzzle based on a model of segmented
              financial market - a particular type of financial friction by
              which the bulk of the nominal exchange rate risk is held by a
              small group of financial intermediaries and not shared smoothly
              throughout the economy. We argue that rather than discriminating
              between models with sticky versus flexible prices, or monetary
              versus productivity shocks, the Mussa puzzle provides sharp
              evidence in favor of models with monetary non-neutrality arising
              due to financial market segmentation. Sticky prices are neither
              necessary, nor sufficient for the qualitative success of the

  abstract  = "This paper examines the relationship between sovereign bond
               spreads, local economic activity, and global financial risk. We
               use secondary-market prices of dollar-denominated sovereign
               securities to construct yield spreads between sovereign bond
               yields and yields on the appropriately defined default risk-free
               securities, constructed using zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yields.
               We use these spreads to construct country-specific sovereign
               bond spreads for a sample of almost 50 countries over the
               1980-2012 period. We then examine the extent to which movements
               in sovereign spreads are determined by local risk factors, such
               as fluctuations in exchange rates and local stock market
               returns, versus global risk factors that arguably proxy for
               risk-attitudes that prevail in U.S. financial markets. To
               measure global risk factors we rely on the excess bond premium
               constructed by Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012). The excess bond
               premium is a measure of distress in U.S. corporate bond markets
               and comoves closely with conditions in financial markets.
               According to GZ, the excess bond premium provides a quantitative
               measure of the risk-attitudes of financial intermediaries. Our
               results indicate that a substantial portion of the comovement
               among sovereign spreads can be accounted for by changes in such
               global risk factors. We also examine the extent to which, during
               the 2007-09 financial crisis, such global risk factors were
               related to perceived default risk in the U.S. financial sector.
               Next, we extend our methodology to construct credit spreads for
               euro-denominated sovereign bonds for about 40 countries over the
               2000-2012 period, and we examine the implications of our
               empirical pricing framework for comovement among sovereign
               spreads during the ongoing turmoil in European sovereign debt
               markets. Lastly, we study the e{\^A}¬ßect of various
               stabilization policy announcements during the recent financial
               crisis on sovereign bond spreads through the global risk
               factors. We also compare the impacts of stabilization policy
               measures during financial crises in the past. Lastly, we
               construct a general equilibrium model of sovereign debt and
               default to rationalize the empirical findings. The model
               features include a risk-averse global investor, optimal default,
               and endogenous debt dynamics for multiple countries. The
               sovereign default and bond prices depend on the borrower's
               economic conditions as well as the lender's risk aversion and
               riskiness. We quantitatively examine the link between the
               financial risk that the lender faces and the distribution of

  abstract = "In the period since 1990, sovereign debt renegotiations take an
              average of five years for bank loans but only one year for bonds.
              We provide an explanation for this finding by highlighting one
              key difference between bank loans and bonds: bank loans are
              rarely traded, while bonds are heavily traded on the secondary
              market. In our theory, the secondary market plays a crucial
              information revelation role in shortening renegotiations.
              Consider a dynamic bargaining game with incomplete information
              between a government and creditors. The creditors' reservation
              value is private information, and the government knows only its
              distribution. Delays in reaching agreements arise in equilibrium
              because the government uses costly delays to screen the
              creditors' reservation value. When the creditors trade on the
              secondary market, the market price conveys information about
              their reservation value, which lessens the information friction
              and reduces the renegotiation duration. We find that the
              secondary market tends to increase the renegotiation payoff of
              the government but decrease that of the creditors while
              increasing the total payoff. We then embed these renegotiation
              outcomes in a simple sovereign debt model to analyze the ex ante
              welfare implications. The secondary market has the potential to
              increase the government ex ante welfare when the information

               emerging and established market nations. The authors draw
               important lessons from history to show us how much---or how
               little---we have learned.Using clear, sharp analysis and
               comprehensive data, Reinhart and Rogoff document that financial
               fallouts occur in clusters and strike with surprisingly
               consistent frequency, duration, and ferocity. They examine the
               patterns of currency crashes, high and hyperinflation, and
               government defaults on international and domestic debts---as
               well as the cycles in housing and equity prices, capital flows,
               unemployment, and government revenues around these crises. While
               countries do weather their financial storms, Reinhart and Rogoff
               prove that short memories make it all too easy for crises to
               recur.An important book that will affect policy discussions for

               typically those of developing countries) to foreign investors
               seeking a competitive return. Most recently sovereign debt has
               taken the form primarily of loans from commercial banks,
               although in earlier periods, governments raised funds abroad
               mainly through bonds issued in foreign capital markets. Whatever
               form it has taken, three broad facts have characterized
               sovereign debt: (1) governments have at times been able to
               borrow substantial amounts; (2) much of what they borrow, they
               eventually repay; and (3) repayment is often complicated,
               involving delay, renegotiation, public intervention, and
               default. The chapter provides an overview of these facts. It
               focuses on three central questions. The first question is why
               countries ever choose to repay their debts. The second question
               is what can go wrong. The last question is what can be done to
               correct these problems. The chapter also presents a discussion

               capital flows between a lender and a borrower in an environment
               in which there are two impediments to forming contracts. The
               first impediment to contracting arises from the assumption that

               borrowed funds. This assumption leads to a moral hazard problem

               that the borrower, as a sovereign nation, may choose to
               repudiate his debts. The optimal contract is shown to specify
               that the borrowing country experience a capital outflow when the

              dollar debt increases, weakening the currencies of countries with
              large amounts of dollar debt and impeding their consumptions.
              Because the dollar tends to strengthen in bad times,
              high-dollar-debt currencies are bad hedges and thus have to offer
              high risk premia. My empirical findings support this idea. First,
              dollar debt captures exchange-rate and debt-issuance responses to
              U.S. monetary policy shocks. Second, dollar debt captures the

  abstract  = "The central claim in this paper is that by explicitly
               introducing costs of international trade (narrowly, transport
               costs, but more broadly, tariffs, nontariff barriers, and other
               trade costs), one can go far toward explaining a great number of
               the main empirical puzzles that international macroeconomists
               have struggled with over twenty-five years. Our approach
               elucidates J. McCallum's home-bias-in-trade puzzle, the
               Feldstein-Horioka saving-investment puzzle, the French-Poterba
               equity-home-bias puzzle, and the Backus-Kehoe-Kydland
               consumption-correlations puzzle. That one simple alteration to
               an otherwise canonical international macroeconomic model can
               help substantially to explain such a broad range of empirical
               puzzles, including some that previously seemed intractable,
               suggests a rich area for future research. We also address a
               variety of international pricing puzzles, including the
               purchasing-power-parity puzzle emphasized by Rogoff, and what we
               term the exchange-rate disconnect puzzle. The latter category of
               riddles includes the Meese-Rogoff exchange-rate forecasting
               puzzle and the Baxter-Stockman
               neutrality-of-exchange-rate-regime puzzle. Here, although many
               elements need to be added to our extremely simple model, trade
               costs still play an essential role.",

  abstract  = "Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on two puzzles related to
               international financial markets. The first puzzle concerns
               explanations for deviations from uncovered interest parity or,
               equivalently, excess returns on foreign relative to domestic
               deposits. The chapter considers various explanations for the
               puzzle. First, under standard assumptions about rational
               expectations, ex post excess returns just equal the market's
               true expected excess returns plus a forecast error that is
               unpredictable ex ante. The second puzzle is called ``home
               bias,'' the phenomenon that domestic investors hold too little
               of their portfolios in foreign assets. The chapter considers
               this puzzle with the two models used to examine the foreign
               exchange risk premium. Both models suggest that domestic
               investors hold too little of their wealth in the form of foreign
               assets. The first type of model, based upon CAPM, implies that
               domestic investors should hold foreign assets in their portfolio
               in a fraction that depends upon their degree of risk aversion,
               among other variables. The second type of model, based upon
               complete markets, gives predictions about consumption

               is an asset that is (almost always) valued at face value without

               to producing (private) information about its value, and this is
               common knowledge. Consequently, agents need not fear adverse
               selection when buying or selling safe assets. Safe assets can be
               easily used to exchange for goods or services or for another
               asset. These short-term safe assets can be money or money-like.
               A long-term safe asset can store value over time or be used as
               collateral. Much of human history can be written in terms of the

              fiscal limits, which measure the government's ability to service
              its debt, arise endogenously from dynamic Laffer curves. The
              state-dependent distributions of fiscal limits depend on the
              growth of lump-sum transfers, the size of the government, the
              degree of countercyclical policy responses, and economic
              diversity. The country-specific fiscal limits imply that the
              market perceives the riskiness of sovereign debt issued by
              different countries to be different, which is consistent with the
              observation that developed countries are downgraded at different

              financially integrated economies. Under financial integration
              banks optimally diversify their holdings of sovereign debt in an
              effort to minimize the costs with respect to an individual
              country's sovereign debt default. Although diversification
              generates risk diversification benefits ex ante, it also

              integration without fiscal integration results in an inefficient
              equilibrium supply of government debt. The safest governments
              inefficiently restrict the amount of high-quality debt that could
              be used as collateral in the financial system and the riskiest
              governments issue too much debt, as they do not take account of
              the costs of contagion. Those inefficiencies can be removed by

              predictions: government defaults should lead to declines in
              private credit, and these declines should be larger in countries
              where financial institutions are more developed and banks hold

              alternative asymptotic framework to assess the properties of
              these inference procedures. This theoretical approach is
              conceptually distinct from the traditional approach (based on
              asymptotic linearity of the estimator and Edgeworth expansions),
              and leads to different theoretical prescriptions for

              invalid in general. This result shows a fundamental lack of

              perturbations of the bandwidth choice, and hence exhibits
              demonstrable superior theoretical statistical properties over the
              traditional bootstrap-based inference procedures. Finally, we

               aversion (DARA). By incorporating risk averse investors who
               trade with an emerging economy, the present model explains a

               flows, and bond prices are a function not only of the
               fundamentals of the economy but also of the level of financial

               counterparties per organization) have different, nonmonotonic
               effects on the extent of cascades. Diversification connects the
               network initially, permitting cascades to travel; but as it
               increases further, organizations are better insured against one
               another's failures. Integration also faces trade-offs: increased
               dependence on other organizations versus less sensitivity to own
               investments. Finally, we illustrate the model with data on
               European debt cross-holdings.",

  abstract = "Information cascades are important dynamical processes in complex
              networks. An information cascade can describe the spreading
              dynamics of rumour, disease, memes, or marketing campaigns, which
              initially start from a node or a set of nodes in the network. If
              conditions are right, information cascades rapidly encompass
              large parts of the network, thus leading to epidemics or epidemic
              spreading. Certain network topologies are particularly conducive
              to epidemics, while others decelerate and even prohibit rapid
              information spreading. Here we review models that describe
              information cascades in complex networks, with an emphasis on the
              role and consequences of node centrality. In particular, we
              present simulation results on sample networks that reveal just
              how relevant the centrality of initiator nodes is on the latter
              development of an information cascade, and we define the
              spreading influence of a node as the fraction of nodes that is
              activated as a result of the initial activation of that node. A
              systemic review of existing results shows that some centrality
              measures, such as the degree and betweenness, are positively
              correlated with the spreading influence, while other centrality
              measures, such as eccentricity and the information index, have
              negative correlation. A positive correlation implies that
              choosing a node with the highest centrality value will activate
              the largest number of nodes, while a negative correlation implies
              that the node with the lowest centrality value will have the same
              effect.We discuss possible applications of these results, and we
              emphasize how information cascades can help us identify nodes
              with the highest spreading capability in complex networks.",

              this paper, we give a comprehensive survey for learning-to-rank.
              First, we discuss the different approaches along with different

              combine with other machine learning paradigms such as
              semi-supervised learning, active learning, reinforcement learning

              Mutual Fund Portfolios",
  author   = "Converse, Nathan and Mallucci, Enrico",
  abstract = "How does sovereign risk affect investors' behavior? We answer
              this question using a novel database that combines sovereign
              default probabilities for 27 developed and emerging markets with
              monthly data on the portfolios of individual bond mutual funds.
              We first show that changes in yields do not fully compensate
              investors for additional sovereign risk, so that bond funds
              reduce their exposure to a country's assets when its sovereign
              default risk increases. However, the magnitude of the response
              varies widely across countries. Fund managers aggressively reduce
              their exposure to high-debt countries and high-risk countries. By
              contrast, they are more lenient toward core developed markets. In
              this sense, these economies appear to receive preferential
              treatment. Second, we document what determines the destination of
              reallocation ows. When fund managers reduce their exposure to a
              country in response to its sovereign risk, they shift their
              assets to countries outside the immediate geographic region while
              at the same time avoiding countries with high debt-to-GDP ratios
              and markets to which they are already heavily exposed. These
              results are supportive of models of sovereign default that assign
              a nontrivial role to the preferences of international creditors.",
